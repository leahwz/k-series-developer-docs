Device Type
===============
Lightspeed Restaurant K-Series POS has two types of devices: **Active Devices** and **Passive Devices**.

---

**Active Devices** are the host POS devices. They are in charge of administering the data traffic between the Back Office and all POS devices on site. Only active devices can receive and process online orders.

The **Preferred Active Device** is the main host if there are multiple active devices. Data will be transferred to this active device first, and if the system cannot administer the request, data will be redirected to another active device.

**Passive Devices**  are auxiliary POS devices. They have less functionality than the principal active device. Passive devices can only be used if there is an active device connected to the same network.
